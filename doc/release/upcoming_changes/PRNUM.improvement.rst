``f2py -c`` links with Intel Fortran on Windows
-----------------------------------------------
With ``ifort`` or ``ifx`` on Windows, the ``meson`` backend now compiles
Fortran sources with ``/names:lowercase`` and ``/assume:underscore``, the
symbol names that the generated C wrappers call. Linking no longer fails with
unresolved external symbols such as ``fib_``. To keep the Intel defaults, pass
``--f90flags="/names:uppercase /assume:nounderscore"`` together with
``-DUPPERCASE_FORTRAN -DNO_APPEND_FORTRAN``.

``f2py -c`` honours more build options with the meson backend
-------------------------------------------------------------
* Extension modules are now linked by the Fortran compiler, which adds its
  runtime library. Modules built with LLVM ``flang`` no longer fail to import
  with undefined ``_Fortran*`` symbols.
* ``-D<macro>[=<value>]`` and ``-U<macro>`` are passed to the C and the Fortran
  compiler again, as they were with ``numpy.distutils``. This covers both the
  macros documented in the ``f2py`` usage text for the C wrapper, such as
  ``-DF2PY_REPORT_ON_ARRAY_COPY=<int>``, and macros used when preprocessing
  Fortran sources.
* ``--debug`` selects a debug build again. It used to be dropped, while any
  ``--f77flags`` or ``--f90flags`` value containing the word ``debug``
  selected a debug build instead.
* Relative ``-I`` and ``-L`` directories and extra object files in other
  directories are now found. They are resolved against the working directory,
  as the rest of the command line is, instead of the build directory.
* ``-I`` and ``--include-paths`` directories are searched in the order they are
  given. They were reordered at random, so an include file present in more
  than one of them could be taken from any of them.
